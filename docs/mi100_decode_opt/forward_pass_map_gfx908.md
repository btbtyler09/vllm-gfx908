# Flash-Next decode step map (gfx908, TP4, rc7 tree + push AR, c=1)

One decode token, kernel by kernel, as the captured FULL graph launches it. Times are graph-timed cold per launch (3K context); bytes are per rank. Sources: agents/graph_branch, agents/qsa_glue, agents/ar_track, agents/spec_research, agents/isa_research. Step total measured in-server: 9.55 ms (kernel bodies ~5.9 ms; the rest is ~1,050 nodes of dispatch, all-reduce skew and the eager step boundary).

Per-rank bytes per token: HC mixes W8 636 MB, GDN int8 519, experts W4 365, lm_head 159, router bf16 126, QSA W4 78, misc ~30 = 1.91 GB.

## Where 9.55 ms goes

Kernel bodies alone sum to about 5.9 ms of graph-timed cold time. The rest of the measured step is what a ~1,050-node graph costs on this GPU: 1.4–1.8 µs of dispatch per node, launch tails, all-reduce skew across four ranks, and the eager pre-step metadata plus the logits gather at the boundary.

## Step prologue once per step

| # | launch | kind | bytes | us | what it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | embedding gather + repeat(1, hc) | aten ×2 | – | ~4 | Token embedding row, replicated into the 4 hyper-connection streams. |
| 2 | PLE input chain: cummax ×2, n-gram ids, zero-copy gather, 5 KB all-reduce, copy | mixed ×12 | host RAM | ~40 | Layer 1 only. Per-layer embedding rows read straight from the pinned checkpoint shards on the host (no device copy of the 95 GB table), then reduced across ranks. |
| 3 | PLE layer body: query norm, gate (dot·sign·sqrt·sigmoid), norm_conv, short-conv decode | eager ×16 | – | ~45 | Still eager glue; the largest un-fused block left outside the layer loop. |

## GDN layer × 36 · 17 launches · ~105 µs

Gated DeltaNet linear attention. Inputs: the four HC streams from the previous layer's MoE output and injection. Node 5 is the one independent branch in the whole layer; everything else is a chain.

## QSA layer × 12 (every 4th) · ~25 launches · ~145 µs at 3K context

Sparse attention with a learned indexer: compressed key blocks are scored, the top 512 per query are selected, and only those are attended. Before the glue fusion this layer launched 45 kernels; the crossed-out group below is what one HIP kernel now does.

## Step epilogue once per step

| # | launch | kind | bytes | us | what it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | final mixer combine_and_mix | HIP ×3 | 6.6 MB | ~15 | Collapses the 4 HC streams to the hidden state. |
| 2 | graph replay ends → eager | boundary | – | skew | Rank 0 carries 0.2–0.3 ms more work than ranks 1–3 and pays it here; the in-graph logits path (rc8 arm) targets this. |
| 3 | lm_head · w8sw_gemv (int8, vocab shard) | HIP GEMV | 159 MB | ~150 | 62080×2560 per rank, one row. |
| 4 | logits all-gather (RCCL) | RCCL | 121→485 KB | 57 | The only RCCL collective left in the step; custom xGMI gather is gated for rc8. |

## Reading the map

Sources: agents/graph_branch (per-layer DAG and node times), agents/qsa_glue (QSA inventory before/after), agents/ar_track (collectives, skew), agents/spec_research (byte ledger), agents/isa_research (dispatch cost). Times are graph-timed cold microbenches per launch at 3K context; in-server the same kernels sit inside a ~1,050-node graph whose dispatch and tails make up the difference to the measured 9.55 ms.
