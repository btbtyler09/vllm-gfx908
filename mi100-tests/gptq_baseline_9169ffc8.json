Here's a simple explanation of the process:\n\n1. **Input Data**: The network receives input data (like images, text, numbers) that it needs to process.\n\n2. **Initial Guess**: The network makes an initial guess about the correct output based on the input. This guess is usually random at first because the network hasn't learned anything yet.\n\n3. **Compare with Correct Answer**: The network compares its guess to the actual correct answer (this is called the \"label\" in supervised learning). The difference between the guess and the correct answer is called the **error**.\n\n4. **Adjust Weights**: The network then adjusts its internal parameters (called **weights**) to reduce the error. This adjustment is done using a method called **backpropagation**, which calculates how much each weight contributed to the error and updates them accordingly.\n\n5. **Repeat**: This process is repeated many times with different examples from",
